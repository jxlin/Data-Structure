Data-Structure
==============
O(n) runtime, O(n) space â€“ Minor space optimization:

If a new element is larger than the current minimum, we do not need to push it on to the min stack. When we perform the pop operation, check if the popped element is the same as the current minimum. If it is, pop it off the min stack too.
